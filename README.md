# Book Club Tracker

App that makes tracking their home book club much easier. Users can create a club, add members to that club and club members can submit books to be voted on. After a member has voted, they can view the current voting results. Book information is pulled from Google Books API. Built using React, Express, Node, MongoDb and Material UI. Previously was hosted on Heroku but it went away with the free tier. Working on getting it back up and running soon.
